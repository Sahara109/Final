    <div class="yesmeme">
<p>I am a simple person who loves to find perfection in imperfection. I find myself happy with my family and friends.<br>
    I am not trying to be different from everybody else but just trying to be myself beacuse I believe there is nobody better than you.<br>
    I love to travel with my family and I enjoy listening to music and my favourite artist is Selena Gomez. She inspires me a lot. <br>
    I love to watch dramatic series and you will find me sketching in my free time. <br><br>
    I am a learner. I am Learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am learning Java and Python. <br> 
    I have created simple websites. I also have created simple systems using Java and Python. I am really interested in web designing and want to learn more about it in further levels.</p>
